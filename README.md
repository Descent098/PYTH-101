# PYTH-101 Beginner Python Course

The purpose of this repository is to go through each set of exercises sequentially to help you learn python. Once you have finished reading this file you can start from ```0. Basic syntax and additional course information``` to get the ball rolling.



## Why Python?

**Why would you ever want to use python?** 

Python is an incredibly prominent language in the development community, industry and hobbyists. There are many reasons for this, but here are some of the main ones:

1. Python is popular; This means the community of people answering online questions, creating videos, and packages is huge and ever growing.

2. It is fast to develop for; Python makes iterative development incredibly fast, it is short and simple to read + write which makes it ideal for prototyping.

3. Wide range of fields; Python is used in everything from web development, to IoT devices, to the hacking community, to server maintenance/monitoring, to deployment systems etc.



**Why not learn java, or rust, or c or (insert language here)?**

A: I would never suggest you don't learn many languages (I have learned the ones in this list and a few more), but for beginners python is definitely the most syntactically simple language. This means you can focus on the programming and not the format of the files so much. As opposed to most other languages.

## Note about markdown files

Markdown files (files that end in .md) are intended to be read in a markdown viewer. The easiest way to read the readme's in each folder is to keep https://github.com/Descent098/PYTH-101 open in github and navigate to each folder. Github has a built in markdown viewer that will let you read the files in their intended format right on your webpage.
