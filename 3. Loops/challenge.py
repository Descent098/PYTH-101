    =========== Challenge 1 =============

    The code below generates a random number
    make a game that loops and takes user input 
    at the command line. The input is the user's
    guess at what the number is. Taking their input
    you should print either: 'too high', 'too low' or
    'Correct guess'.

    For example let's assume the number is 4 a sample
    output of the game would look like this:
        >> Enter Guess: 2
        Too Low
        >> Enter Guess: 5
        Too High
        >> Enter Guess: 4
        Correct Guess
"""

import random

number = random.randint() # Generates a random number


"""
    =========== Challenge 2 =============

    Take two inputs from the command line, then
    convert both to an int the first number will
    be the starting number, and the second will be
    the ending number. Create a loop that goes from
    the starting number to the ending number, and only
    prints the even numbers.

    =========== Challenge 3 =============

    THIS CHALLENGE IS HARD, DON'T GET DISCOURADGED
                IF YOU CAN'T DO IT!

    Using the list below print the numbers
    in ascending order. It should look like this: 
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9

    HINT: The simplest (and shortest) way to do this
    is with a loop counter variable, and a while loop.

numbers = [[1, 4, 7], [2 ,5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
