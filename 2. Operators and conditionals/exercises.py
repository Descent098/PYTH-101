    =========== Exercise 2 =============

    Take input from the command line, and convert it to
    an int. Now pick a range (i.e. 0-10), and create a set
    of conditional statements that prints the string
    representation of the number input by the user.

    For example if someone put in 8, then it would print 'eight'.
    
    Hint: Use if, elif and else statements.
