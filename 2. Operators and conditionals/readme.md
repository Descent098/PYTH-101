# Operators and Conditionals



## Operators

Operators are symbols built into python that allow for special functionality such as addition, subtraction and



#### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are operators used to do basic arithmetic (hence the name). What this means is that they are the basis for any calculations you need to make in a program.

##### Shortcuts

Many of the operations you are doing are going to involve taking the original value of a variable doing an operation and storing the result back in the variable. For example: 

```python
variable_1 = 5 # Initialize the variable to 5

variable_1 = variable_1 + 5 # Take the current value of the variable and add 5

variable_1 = variable_1 - 5 # Take the current value of the variable and subtract 5

variable_1 = variable_1 / 2 # Take the current value of the variable and floating point divide by 2

variable_1 = variable_1 // 2 # Take the current value of the variable and integer divide by 2
```



For addition, subtraction, multiplication and division there is a shortcut to do the above operations. The general form is ```variable_name <operator>= value```

```python
variable_1 = 5 # Initialize the variable to 5

variable_1 += 5 # Take the current value of the variable and add 5

variable_1 -= 5 # Take the current value of the variable and subtract 5

variable_1 /= 2 # Take the current value of the variable and floating point divide by 2

variable_1 //= 2 # Take the current value of the variable and integer divide by 2
```



##### Modulus

What this actually does is returns the **remainder** to the division of the two terms.
