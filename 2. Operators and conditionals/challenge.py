    =========== Challenge 1 =============

    Take an input from the command line, then
    convert it to an int and if it is even 
    print 'the number is even' otherwise print
    'the number is odd'.

"""
    =========== Challenge 2 =============

    Take an input from the command line, and 
    convert it to an int. Validate the number
    is within the range 1-5, and then for each
    possible value (1-5), write the code to make
    the input 11.

    I.e. Someone inputs 1 the result is 11, if someone
    inputs 2 the result is 11 etc. If someone puts in a
    number not in range (1-5) print:
        'value not between 1-5 please try again'
    
    Hint: You should have between 6-7 if/elif/else statements
